# AI Search Optimization for 3D Traveling Salesman Problem

## Overview
This repository contains the programming assignment for CSCI 561, focusing on AI search/optimization techniques applied to a 3D Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The goal is to develop an AI agent using Genetic Algorithms to find the shortest path visiting all given locations exactly once and returning to the starting point.

## Problem Description
- **Scenario**: A student at USC needs to find the shortest route for errands across campus using a TSP approach.
- **Implementation**: Using Genetic Algorithm to compute the most efficient path through a set of given 3D coordinates representing locations on the USC campus.

## Dataset
The project uses a list of 3D coordinates, with each coordinate representing a location on the USC campus.
